# Test Driven Development Demo

In this demo, we build a caesar cipher using TDD principles.

## Setup

This project was created using `npm init` and then following the instructions in the Jest docs for getting started: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html

It is set up to use Jest as the test runner and includes Babel to support newer JavaScript features and syntax.
